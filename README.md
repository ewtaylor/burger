Burgers!:
I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

Description:
1) A full stack application 
2) The front end is implemented with HTML/CSS, as well as elements from the Materialize framework 
3) HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars
4) The backend implemented with Node.js and Express. 

Results:
1) The user can enter any burger name to add it to the menu
2) This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database
3) The burger entry is added as available on the menu
4) The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it


Installation:
To run the application locally,  clone this repository with the following command.
