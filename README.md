A Burger! :P
We created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

Description
-A full stack application 
-The front end is implemented with HTML/CSS, as well as elements from the Materialize framework 
-HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars
-The backend implemented with Node.js and Express. 

Results
-The user can enter any burger name to add it to the menu
-This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database
-The burger entry is added as available on the menu
-The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it


Installation
To run the application locally,  clone this repository with the following command.

git clone git@github.com:ewtaylor/burger.git
